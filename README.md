# Data Library
Curation of waste related datasets. Would be interesting to use this space to note the **maintainers** of these datasets. 

+ **[Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Food-Scrap-Drop-Off-Locations-in-NYC/if26-z6xq)**: DSNY maintained dataset of food drop-off sites. Includes lat/longs, community district numbers, and census tract info. 
+ **[Geographical data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page)**: contains shapefiles and geojson for all kinds of political and administrative districts.
